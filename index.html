          <h3>Why is Tim Burton one of the best directors?</h3>
          <p>
            Tim Burton is known for pioneering goth culture in the American film industry and is famous for his
            gothic
            horror and fantasy
            films.
            As one of the earliest students of the famed Character Animation Program, his work attracted the attention
            of
            Walt
            Disney Productions and gained him an apprenticeship at the studio. However, long before becoming a director,
            Burton expressed himself through drawing, painting, and photography, all of which have
            became an integral part of his creative process which he continues to pursue to this day.
            Over the years, Tim Burton has achieved both critical and commercial success in the live-action and
            animation
            genres, with that some of his iconic projects involving "Frankenweenie" (1984), "Beetlejuice" (1988) and
            "Edward Scissorhands" (1990) to only name a few. He has received numerous accolades including an Emmy Award,
            and a Golden Globe Award as well as
            nominations for
            two Academy Awards and three BAFTA Awards.

          <p>
            Hi! My name is Martyna and I love movies but one of my favourite styles is the 'Burtonesque' style by Tim
            Burton. As his movies exaggerate gothic images and unique characters, the way he brings them to life makes
            the
            audience care for them a lot more. Because who doesn't love a little bit of mystery!
